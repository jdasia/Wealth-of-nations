# Wealth-of-nations

### Introduction
In this report, I took a look at three different variable of nations namely, GDP per capita, Life expectancy and number of smartphone users. 

### Scenario
Data analysis has taken over. 

### Data Sourcing 
The data for this analysis was provided through an Excel file containing three tables with the variables, GDP per capita, Life expectancy at birth and smartphone users as columns next to the unique identifier, 'country.' The datasets were not created for the same range of nations therefore, there are more than two hundred nations for GDP, less than a hundred for Life Expectancy and almost two hundred nations recorded for their number of smartphone users. 

### Data Transformation
This data was already mostly in the right format. Using data validation methods in Excel, I checked each table for duplicates and there were none. I filtered the GDP per capita table using a pivot table to get all records for the year, 2019 and also for the top 20. After this I was ready to create some visualisations and draw some insights. 

### Analysis and Visualisation 
In Tableau I linked all three tables together based on the respective field names for nation(s).
Analysis required an assessment of the relationships between GDP per capita and the other two variables to find out if there were any clear relationships between them. This formed the most insightful part of the analysis after investigating GDP by filtering for the top 20 nations.
